  <h1> (change)New Local Clothes Store Opening on Chestnut Road</h1>
  <br/>
  <body> In the expanding town of Bery, expansions have not ceased with the new opening of a new Clothing distributor.  With lack of variety in the new town, this store will guide the population into the modern era.  With brands like Addias, Puma, and Nike, the store is brimming with customers unlike any other clothing store in the area.  Seeing the community in a variety of colours that we have not seen before has been crucial for the development of this establishment.

  <h2>Customer Reviews on Products</h2>
  <body> Reviews from the customers are more positive than ever coming from Mr. Jackson:
  <blockquote>This store can be described with only a few words;<strong> affordable, quality, convenient</strong>.  I had so many choices to pick from for the sweatshirt I was going to purchase for myself and even more choices for the t-shirt I was going to buy for my brother.  Compared to the other stores in this area, nothing comes close to the quality of this store.  I can’t say it enough, but come on down to purchase some quality clothing for prices that are low. </blockquote>

  <h2> Summary and final acknowledgements </h2>
  <body> Now that you have heard from me, and the fine citizens of the town, you should be more willing than ever to try something new.  This clothing shop is not like every other clothing shop and does not sell just clothing; it sells <strong>pride and honor</strong> which can not be said for every store.  If you are ever in need of a replacement piece of clothing or even a gift idea for someone special in your life, come on down to find quality clothing for affordable prices.

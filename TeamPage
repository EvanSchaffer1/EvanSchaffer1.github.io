<body>
Jared is currently taking a position as Janice's assistant.  Jared demonstrates some of the similar traits that Janice does, but is fairly new to the company with only 2 years of experience currently under his belt.  Even though he is new, you should not under estimate someone with motivation and dedication that matches Jared's.  We can expect great work to come from a person just like this.

<div class="Team">
<img src="Guy3.jpg" alt="Thomas" width="150px" style="float: left; margin-right: 15px;" />
<body>
Our team is actively taking in an "apprentice" or student in our ranks.  Thomas is still in university, but is taking a job to gain experience and to earn money while he is currently in school.  Even though he will technically end his service in about a years time, if he keeps up his good work ethic and dedication, we will offer him a postion once he exits university.

  <p>Jack's Clothing store opened just before Halloween about 5 years ago.  At the time of its release, not many people took it to mind as it was one of many stores that opened in that area.  Jack's Clothing did very little sales during its first year and was barely able to stay afloat due to the high rent in the area.  Even though there was only a limited amount of recuring customers, those that did return often when surprised with the quality of the products they were purchasing.  Before learning more about Jack's Clothing, we would like to get some user feedback about previous experiences with clothing stores of this style.</p>

  <p>Now that we have collected your feedback on some of the other clothing stores that you have visited during your times shopping, we would like to show you how the quality of the product and experience inside of Jack's Clothing store is unmatched.  To use as an example, aa typical hoodie or fleece that you would find in any normal clothing store would feel thin and would not properly protect you from  the cold conditions of the fall and winter.  This type of quality is frowned upon by the designers behind Jack's Clothing with every piece of outerwear being crafted to the highest quality standards.  Every piece that is distributed by the store is ensured to not contain an ounce of forced labor and is made by paid workers.  The best part of all are the prices.  Typical prices of normal clothing that you may own are inflated to earn the owners of the stores more money for the same amount of effort.  This is not the case at Jack's Clothing.</p>

  <p>Now that you have learned about the past of the store and how the team behind the walls keeps the business afloat we will provide you with some reviews from frequent customers.  Janice-"When I first visited the store, I saw it only as a clone of the other clothing stores that I have visited, but this idea quickly changed after I bought some of the clothing.  The prices of the clothing were much less that some of the other stores that I have purchased from."  Chris-"The Clothing quality in this store is no joke.  The prices are low enough for anyone to afford and the quality ensures that the clothing will last for many months or yeares of use which is unlike anything I have ever seen in a simple clothing store."
